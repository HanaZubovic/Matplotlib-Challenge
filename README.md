# Lab Mice Tumor Growth Analysis

## The Challenge
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of a pharmaceutical company's drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## File Directory
- Contained within the "data" folder are the uncleaned `.csv`files used
- The File named `main.ipynb` contains the script for data importing, cleaning, and visualizations meant to be viewed in Jupyter Notebook

## Process:
- Imported all `.csv` files
- Cleaned, sorted, and filtered the data
- Calculated statistics to generate insights
- Using matplotlib, crated several visualizations: Box and Whisker plot, Bar graphs, Pie charts, Line and Scatter plots
- Identified outliers and quartiles
- Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model 

## Results:
